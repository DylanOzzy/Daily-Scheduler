## Project Overview

I made this webpage to demonstrate my current level of knowledge with Javascript and API's to showcase my ability to build light applications. 

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- DayJS

## Features

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar so you know what the date and time are. 
- The User is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm.
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future for easier planning.
- User can click into a timeblock, then user can enter an event, then User click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- When User refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
